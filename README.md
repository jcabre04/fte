# fanfiction-to-ebook
fte is a tool that creates ebooks from online fanfiction by scraping their webpages. It can run as a standalone cli command, a local webapp, a webapp deployed by docker, or as a webapp managed by Kubernetes. The primary use case for fte is to create content for local self-hosted (i.e., no access from outside home LAN) use.

PLEASE NOTE: the docker image uses Flask's development server to serve content. Do not use it for high volume or insecure traffic (e.g., Internet-facing content). 

Also, if you use this tool through the cli, you will need a firefox / chrome on your computer and need to download the latest gecko / chrome web driverto the code's directory.

## Standalone cli command
Attempting to run fte.py without any input will fail and produce a menu explaining how to use it. You can find more details through the help flag: `-h`
```
python fte.py
```

python fte.py -h

## Local webapp
To run fte in a local webapp, install the python packages in `requirements.txt` and start up Flask as shown below.
### cli commands
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m flask --app -e .env application.py run -p <PORT> 
```

### .env file
Some functionality is customizable with the appropriate environemntal variables in an .env file:
```
UPLOAD_DIR="./uploads"    # Which directory to upload .epub files to
WORKING_DIR="."           # Which directory to temporarily use for downloading ebooks from your browser
WEB_DRIVER=firefox        # Which web driver to use. You will need the corresponding browser. firefox or chrome
FLASK_DEBUG=False
```

### webapp
On success, you can reach fte's web application through localhost:\<PORT\>

## Docker image and container
To use docker, execute the following docker run command. The mounted directory will store the files uploaded. Downloading a file will place it in your browser's download directory.
```
docker run --name fte-app -p 42005:42005 --mount type=bind,source="$pwd"/uploads,target=/app/uploads --rm -d jcabre04/fte
```

Alternatively, use docker-compose with fte's docker-compose.yaml file:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Kubernetes
The project contains a Kubernetes configuration file for easy deployment in a Kubernetes cluster. Assuming the cluster and kubectl were setup correclty, run the following command to deploy it:
```
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes.yaml
```
